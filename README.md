# Astroids Game

This project is my exam project in the subject AIS1003.
I have programmed a new take on the classic arcade game
Asteroids. The main differences between my version, and the
classic version is that my version have collition detection
between astroids, even though it is a bit wonky, but most of
the time it works all of the time. In addition
I don't have astroids that split up when they get shot, but
I have also added explotions when they get shot.

The setting for the game is the scene from the movie "The 
Empire Strikes Back", where the Millenium Falcon is navigated
through an astroid field to escape chasing Thai Fighters.
That is some of the reason for the bad bots. 

## Dependencies
This Project is built using Threepp. Which is a port of the
popular JavaScript libarary Three.js. Other than that, I
have just used the standard libarary for C++.

## Executing Program
You can run the program by using the green run button at the
top line in CLion or Visual Studio.
